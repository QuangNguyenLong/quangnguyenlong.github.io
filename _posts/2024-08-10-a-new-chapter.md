**A small gathering, a significant transition.**

Today marks the official start of my journey as the head of FIL Research Group - a role that comes great responsibility but also exciting oppotunities for growth and contribution.

I am deeply grateful to Prof. Truong Thu Huong, Nguyen Hoang Long, and everyone for supported and trusted me along the way. As I take on this new challenge, I will strive to do my best. Love FIL.
