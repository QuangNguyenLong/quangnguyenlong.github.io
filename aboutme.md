title: About me
subtitle: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - Arthur C. Clarke

My name is Nguyen Long Quang. I am a passionate student with a deep interest in the future of immersive multimedia. I believe that everything is possibleâ€”what we often refer to as magic is simply the cover of advanced technology. This belief drives me to explore new frontiers, solve complex problems, and constantly push the boundaries of what's achievable.
